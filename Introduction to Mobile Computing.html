        <h3>Introduction to Mobile Computing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A technology that is capable of providing an environment which enables users to transmit data from one device to other device without the use of any physical link/cables is known as Mobile Computing.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It means, data transmission is done wireless-ly with the help of wireless devices such as mobiles, laptops etc.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Whenever any device is connected to a network without being connected physically over a link or cable, data transmission such as messages, voice recording, videos etc. can be done be done by using the concept of mobile computing.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mobile Computing technology helps users to access and transmit data from any remote locations without being present there physically.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Thus, having such a big coverage diameter, it is one of the fastest and most reliable sectors of computing technology field.</li>
