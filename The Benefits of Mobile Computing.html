The useful step can prepare for particular accident and doctor can consulted for diagnosis. Only Wireless networks work of communication in nature disaster2 such as earthquakes, tsunami,flood and fire .In worst conditions only decentralized, wireless ad-hoc networks survive.Means that can handle Emergencies situation by mobile computing easily.</td>
